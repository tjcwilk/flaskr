                         / Continuouse Integration Demo - Flaskr /


# INTRODUCTION

Flaskr is an example web application that comes bundled with the flask web framework. This repository is a copy of this application, set up so that changes to the application are automatically run though continuouse integration tooling and on to automated deployment.

    1) Travis CI Watches for changes in the mater branch

    2) Travis will initate automated tests which will either block or allow the pipeline

    3) Travis will pass execution over to AWS-CodeDeploy

    4) AWS-CodeDeploy will trigger the actions to kill any currently running flaskr application and deploy the new one.


# THE APPLICATION - FLASKR

The example application is called 'flaskr'. It is a simple bulletin board application backed by a local sqlite database. With the correct credentials, you can log in, post a message and log out.

Flask serves up browser side code from the HTLM and CSS in the /templates directory. Flask also allows the easy implementation of API endpoints that the front end then calls.

For reference, this is how you install and run the flaskr application on a machine:

    1.  Install the dependencie

    pip install .

    2. instruct flask to use the application

    export FLASK_APP=flask

    3. Initialise the database

    flask initdb

    4. run the application

    flask run 
    note: to listen on an external interface use --host=0.0.0.0. Set the port with --port=8080
